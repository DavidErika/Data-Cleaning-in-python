# Data-Cleaning-in-python

## Project Overview
This project involves cleaning and transforming a banking dataset to prepare it for analysis. The primary goal is to address missing values, handle outliers, standardize column formats, and ensure the dataset is suitable for further analysis or modeling.

## Dataset Information
The dataset contains banking transaction records. Key columns include customer IDs, transaction amounts, dates, and transaction types. This project addresses common data issues, such as:
-Missing values

-Inconsistent formatting

-Duplicates

## Steps Performed
### Step 1: Importing Libraries
-Imported essential libraries such as pandas, numpy, and visualization tools like matplotlib and seaborn.

-Verified the installation of required packages.

### Step 2: Loading the Dataset
-Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

-Displayed the first few rows to understand the structure of the data.

### Step 3: Data Cleaning
-Handled missing values:

  -Identified columns with null values.
  
  -Imputed missing values where appropriate.
  
-Removed duplicate rows to ensure data consistency.

-Renamed columns for better readability.

### Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis
-Performed statistical analysis to understand the distribution of key variables.

-Visualized data distributions using histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.

-Identified and addressed outliers.

### Step 5: Data Transformation
-Standardized date formats.

-Normalized numeric columns for uniformity.

-Created new derived columns, such as transaction categories based on predefined rules.

## Results
-Cleaned dataset saved as cleaned_banking_data.csv.

-Improved data quality by addressing missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats.

## Future Improvements
-Integrate additional datasets to enhance analysis.

-Automate the data cleaning pipeline for real-time updates.

-Apply machine learning models for predictive analytics on cleaned data.
